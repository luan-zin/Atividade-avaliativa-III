    <h2>Do you know what liminal spaces are?</h2>

    <p>
    Have you ever felt anxiety or slight discomfort when seeing the image of some unfamiliar place? A sense of familiarity and nostalgia even though you're pretty sure you've never been there? By the end of this video, you will feel that way with some of these images. These are the liminal spaces.</p>

    <p>The term "liminal" is derived from the Latin word "limen," which means threshold or boundary. A liminal space is more than just a physical location. It can also be an emotional, mental, and spiritual state. Liminality is a subjective state of a psychological, neurological, or metaphysical order, conscious or unconscious, of being on the edge or between two different states of existence.</p>

    <p>Liminal Spaces are images of places that break all expectations of their initial objective, context, or expectations of reality itself. They are spaces that somehow lost their purpose. These images evoke a sense of being in-between, neither here nor there, causing an eerie feeling of uncertainty and wonder.</p>

    <p>It's as if these spaces exist on the threshold of reality, where the ordinary transforms into the extraordinary. Time seems to stand still, and the familiar becomes strange. A deserted hallway, an empty parking lot, an abandoned building - these liminal spaces capture moments frozen in time, inviting us to contemplate the stories that unfolded within their walls.</p>

    <p>In these images, we witness the remnants of human presence, traces of life that once flourished but have now given way to silence. The absence of people creates a void that draws us in, making us question what came before and what might come after. These are the places where memories and imagination intertwine, blurring the line between what is known and what is imagined.</p>

    <p>The appeal of liminal spaces lies in their ability to tap into our subconscious, triggering emotions and memories that lie dormant. They challenge our perceptions and force us to confront the impermanence of existence. In the end, these images remind us of the beauty and mystery found in the most unexpected corners of the world.</p>

    <p>So, as you immerse yourself in these liminal spaces, allow your mind to wander, embrace the uncertainty, and let the haunting allure of these images take you on a journey beyond the boundaries of the known. Open your heart to the possibilities, for it is in these enigmatic spaces that we often find the most profound insights into our own human experience.</p>
